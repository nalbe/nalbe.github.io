## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with no experience in web development, data science, and open-source contributions. I enjoy exploring new technologies and sharing knowledge through writing and coding.

## Projects

Here are some of my featured projects:

- **[IPushButton](https://github.com/nalbe/IPushButton)** - Is an Arduino library designed for efficiently handling physical button presses without blocking the main loop. Eliminates unwanted repeated triggers from mechanical button bounce. Supports different press types (short press, long press, double press, etc.). Rapid clicks, acceleration and more. Optimized for minimal memory usage.
- **[Coming soon.](https://github.com/nalbe/project-two)** - An open-source JavaScript library for data visualization.
- **[placeholder](https://github.com/nalbe/project-three)** - A Python-based automation tool to simplify repetitive tasks.

## Blog

I don't write about programming, web development, and best practices in the tech industry. Here are some of my imaginary latest posts:
