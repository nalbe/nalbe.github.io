## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with no experience in web development, data science, and open-source contributions. I enjoy exploring new technologies and sharing knowledge through writing and coding.

## Projects

Here are some of my featured projects:

- **[Why don’t programmers like nature? It has too many bugs.](https://github.com/nalbe/project-one)** - A web application that helps users track their daily tasks efficiently.
- **[Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache.](https://github.com/nalbe/project-two)** - An open-source JavaScript library for data visualization.
- **[Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.](https://github.com/nalbe/project-three)** - A Python-based automation tool to simplify repetitive tasks.

Check out more of my work on my [I'm reading a book on anti-gravity. It's impossible to put down!](https://github.com/nalbe?tab=repositories).

## Blog

I don't write about programming, web development, and best practices in the tech industry. Here are some of my imaginary latest posts:

- [Why don’t skeletons fight each other? They don’t have the guts.](https://nalbe.github.io/blog/async-js)
- [Why do C++ programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.](https://nalbe.github.io/blog/css-grid)
- [Why don’t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything.](https://nalbe.github.io/blog/web-performance)
